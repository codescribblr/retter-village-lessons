# Homework Part 1 -- Due Date: 10/19/21

# The homework this week is to create the beginning of a game using all of the things you've learned so far. To complete the assignment, you'll need to collect 4 pieces of information from the user, store that information in variables, do some math on one of the pieces of information, then display the final output to the user.

# Don't worry. We are NOT making this whole game this week. 

# Look at the game.py file in Monster_Escape/game.py for a full explanation of the game we're building.

# For the first part of the game, you need to find out the following pieces of information:
# 1. The name of their character
# 2. The color of their base (red, green, or blue)
# 3. The character's skill (speed or strength)
# 4. The difficulty level to start the game (1-10, 1 being easiest and 10 being hardest)

# Then you'll need to calculate the character's base HP stat. To do this, you'll need to add the difficulty level the player chose to the base HP stat (10).

# Finally, output the 4 pieces of information to the user and their base HP stat so they can see what they chose.

# Feel free to make this fun by introducing them to the game and giving some hints to the game. Or not. It's you're choice. You're just responsible to output the info.

# Put your final code in the "game_part_1.py" file. Make sure that when I run the file I get the questions and the final output in the console.
