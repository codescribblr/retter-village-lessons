# The homework this week is to create the beginning of a game using all of the things you've learned so far. To complete the assignment, you'll need to collect 4 pieces of information from the user, store that information in variables, do some math on one of the pieces of information, then display the final output to the user.

# Don't worry. We are NOT making this whole game this week. 

# Look at the game.py file in Monster_Escape/game.py for a full explanation of the game we're building.

# For the first part of the game, you need to find out the following pieces of information:
