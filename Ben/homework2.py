# Homework Part 2 -- Due Date: 11/2/21

# To do this homework, you'll need to read and learn from Lessons/conditionals.py

# You'll also need to review Lessons/output.py, Lessons/operators.py, Lessons/booleans.py, and Lessons/variables.py

# This week's homework will expand on what you completed last time. To complete this assignment, you'll need to take the information that the player gave you and calculate the starting values for the game. You'll need to store these starting values in new variables. You can name these whatever you want. Just make them descriptive so that you know what they mean later.

# To call this assignment complete, You'll need to print out the following 4 pieces of information to the player:

# 1. How many squares will the board have?
# 2. How many monsters will be on the board? Bonus if you tell them how many are visible and invisible.
# 3. What team are they on, and which side of the board does that team start?
# 4. What is the starting HP of the player based on the level they chose?

# Bonus: Create variables for the total number of turns taken, moves per turn,  moves left in current turn, base damage of the monsters, and current_score.
# Take the skill that the player chose and calculate the value of their stat based on their chosen skill. If the player chose speed, then make sure they have 2 moves per turn and 2 moves left in the current turn. If the player chose strength, then make sure the monsters are set to deal 1 damage.

# Double Bonus: Create a stat board to display all of these values to the user after each turn.

# Put your final code in the "game_part_2.py" file. Make sure that when I run the file I get the questions and the final output in the console.

# Feel free to email me any questions you have (jonathanwadsworth@gmail.com), and I'll answer as soon as I can.
