# A boolean is a type in python just like strings and integers. 

# A boolean is something that is either true or false. 

# Since computers use 1s and 0s to read everything, a boolean is the simplest way for a computer to read a value. It's either true or it's false.

# In python, the 2 boolean values are "True" and "False". Notice the capital letter. This is important in python. Uncomment the next line and run this file in the shell on the right to see what happens if the word is not capitalized.

# use this command to run the file: "python Lessons/booleans.py"

# boolean_value = true

# Instead of lowercase, python uses and uppercase letter to define the value for True and False. Other languages do not necessarily follow this same pattern. For example, in PHP, true and false can be either all lowercase or all uppercase. But unlike python, they cannot be mixed case.

# In programming, booleans are very important. When we get to comparisons later, the computer will actually compare everything down to it's boolean equivalent. If you're comparing the numbers 1 and 2 for equality you would say something like 1 == 2. The answer to that question is False. 1 != 2. Similarly, 1 < 2 evaluates to True.

# Another way to have a boolean value is the integers 1 & 0. 1 is always True and 0 is always False. Because they're not actually booleans, but rather, they evaluate to boolean values, we call things like this "truthy" and "falsey". So anything that is not 0 is actually truthy--meaning it will evaluate to true. Usually anything that is 0 is falsey--meaning it will evaluate to false.

# Interestingly, the string "True" evaluates to True, but the string "False" does not evaluate to False. It's actually True because it's not 0 or blank.

# We'll test this a bit when we get to comparisons and conditionals.

# This is all you really need to know for now about booleans for now.
