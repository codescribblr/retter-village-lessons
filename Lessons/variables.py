# A variable is a box for storage. It's the way we hold on to values that we want to use later. Variables can be any data type. They can store strings, integers, booleans, arrays, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and objects.

# To create a variable, we just give it a name.

my_var = 1

# Variables have limits to their names. Officially, variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.

# This is illegal (meaning it will fail): 
1st_var = "my first var"

# but this will work:
first_var = "my first variable"

# This won't work either (The minus sign is an operator)
first-var = "Hi everyone!"
