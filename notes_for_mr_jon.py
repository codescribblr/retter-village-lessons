# This is the file where you can type me notes. Please don't type notes in the other files, because we may accidentally delete something. :)

# To leave a note, make a comment and add the first letter of your name after the "#" so I know who asked. So I'd type "#MJ" for Mr. Jon. :)
# ok so i would type something like 'Type left, right, up, down' and else print('You did not pick left, right, up, down try again.'): Ben
#MJ You could do that. It's totally up to you how to tell them the error.
#j ok
#j so i read your game notes  how long do you think it will take to make this game? that sounds like fun.

#MJ We'll make it over the next couple months. As we learn new skills. The homework will have you make it in pieces.
