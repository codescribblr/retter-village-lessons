# You need to use input() to ask the questions. Make sure you assign it to a variable to save the user's answer so you can give it back to them later.
# like this:
# name = input("What's your name?")
#print('Please enter your name for the game.')
#while(x==1) :
#name = input('What is your name? ')
#print(f"Hi, {name}. Welcome to the game.")
#x = 2
print('Please enter your name for the game.')
# x = 1
# comparison operators are == > < <= >=
# while(x==1) :
name = input('What is your name? ')
print(f"Hi, {name}. Welcome to the game.")
# x = 2

# Looks like you started here. You copied a bunch of lines you don't need for this homework. I've commented out those lines and left just the one's you need.

# You need to ask 3 more questions and assign the inputs to variables. Then you need to print the final statement at the end with all 4 variables in it.
