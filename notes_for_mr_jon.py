# This is the file where you can type me notes. Please don't type notes in the other files, because we may accidentally delete something. :)

# To leave a note, make a comment and add the first letter of your name after the "#" so I know who asked. So I'd type "#MJ" for Mr. Jon. :)
# ok so i would type something like 'Type left, right, up, down' and else print('You did not pick left, right, up, down try again.'): Ben
#MJ You could do that. It's totally up to you how to tell them the error.
#j ok
#j so i read your game notes  how long do you think it will take to make this game? that sounds like fun.
#j are you going to spend this much time everyday on this?
#MJ We'll make it over the next couple months. As we learn new skills. The homework will have you make it in pieces.
#j can you put the code in my homework folder so i know what to type.
# ben: HOW DID YOU DO that??????
# B How do you do a variable plus 10?
#MJ let's say the variable name is fish. if you store an integer in the variable, you can do math on it. so if you set fish = 10, then you can do fish = fish + 10. Make sense?
# B it says i have a syntax error but i dont know what it is
#MJ It looks like you've tried to use an if/else statement. But the way you typed it is not quite right. We'll talk about how to do these statements today. :)
